# library_manager

This is a simple CLI library manager I wrote in dart.
I used this project to teach myself Dart's IO and filesystem, and it is currently being worked on.
I'll give my final judgement to dart (if I'll continue using it, etc) at the end of the readme if you'd bother to read it.

## Usage

`$ libman`

All managing takes place inside the application, using `EXIT` when prompted to exit and save the application.

## Verdict

As of November 18th, 2024, I like using dart, however I have a couple notes about the language:
* Wtf why are the constructors built like that? I get an error on `List()` but none on `List.empty()`
* Why is the output like that `stdout` makes me sob
* Why is `new` a keyword if you don't need it

The rest as i write, i have not used the filesystem yet so we'll see how that goes
